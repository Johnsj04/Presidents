Project 17 — The Hall of Presidents

The goal for this project is to create a responsive website that displays 
the portraits of the Presidents of the United States.
Each picture should include information about each President.
The information can be presented in any way you wish, but it 
always has to accompany the portrait as it is position for responsiveness.
If you were to view such a website on a mobile phone’s web browser, 
each Presidential portrait might be positioned one on top of another.
Styling and content are completely up to you. Responsiveness and Semantics 
are the key.
